This branch is used for RNA_seq data analysis.
----------------------------------------------
The RNA sequencing data is generated from Tm-treated Arabidopsis seedlings.
Totally there are four different experimental groups.
-----------------------------------------------------
Time Point settings:
--------------------
0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64 (hours)
-------------------------------
Labelled samples in five groups:
--------------------------------
I. The control sample collected at time point 0. (No.1)
II. Untreated samples collected at various time points. (No.2-7)
III. Tm-treated samples collected at various time points. (No.8-13)
IV. Untreated samples collected at 64 hours (No.14-19)
V. Tm-treated samples collected at 64 hours (No.20-25)
